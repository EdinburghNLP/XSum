Wanda Campbell, 43, of Auchenmalg near Newton Stewart, was jailed for three years earlier this month.
She was also ordered to pay compensation of £110,000 at Dumfries Sheriff Court.
Her appeal against that sentence and the conviction will be heard at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh.
She was found guilty after a seven-day trial of acting with others to take the money from James Haugh Castle Douglas between March 2012 and October 2013.
