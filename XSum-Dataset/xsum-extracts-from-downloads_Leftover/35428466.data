The Â£45m facility, to be built at Sutherland Drive in Kilmarnock, will house primary and secondary schools, a Gaelic school and a childcare centre.
East Ayrshire Council said it would ask permission from the McIlvanney family to name the campus in his honour.
The renowned writer was born and educated in Kilmarnock.
Council leader Douglas Reid said he was delighted to be able to "preserve" the William McIlvanney name in Kilmarnock as the writer was "passionate about the provision of good education for young people".
McIlvanney became an English teacher after graduating from Glasgow University but changed career in 1975 to write full time.
He gained immediate recognition with the publication of his first novel - Remedy Is None - and through other works he earned the title of "Godfather of Tartan Noir".
McIlvanney wrote the acclaimed Laidlaw trilogy and other Glasgow-based works such as Docherty and The Big Man.
He was also an influential poet, journalist and broadcaster, and contributed to political and sporting life in Scotland through a series of columns and TV programmes.
The novelist died at his Glasgow home on 5 December.
