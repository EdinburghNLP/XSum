A 16-year-old boy was also stabbed and taken to a north London hospital for treatment. His remains in a stable condition, said police.
They said Che had been invited to the party, which appeared to be "a well-run event with appropriate adults in attendance".
They believed he was not involved in an early altercation with a group of youths denied entry to the party.
But he appeared to have been targeted later, a spokesman said.
Det Chief Insp Chris Jones said he wanted to speak to anyone who was near the alleyway between Belvedere Way and Tylers Gate when Che was stabbed.
A man aged 21 has been arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to a west London police station for questioning.
Two boys aged 15 and 16 were also arrested on suspicion of murder and bailed until mid-December.
A third, aged 14, is being held on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon.
