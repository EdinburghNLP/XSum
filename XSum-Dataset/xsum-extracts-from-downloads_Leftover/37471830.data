The first incident saw a 71-year-old woman from Sandyhills tricked by someone claiming to work for BT.
Now a woman in Stranraer has lost money to a caller who said he was contacting her about problems with her internet.
He claimed to be from BT technical support and gained remote access to her computer to take the cash.
The Sandyhills incident happened on 15 September with the Stranraer con taking place seven days later.
PC Siobhan Pellett said: "The ease with which these people seem to be able to gain access to their victim's computer is frightening and the sums of money being taken are substantial.
"We are asking people to be very, very careful when answering a cold call from someone who tries to gain remote access to their computer in order to rectify an alleged fault.
"Our message is worth repeating once again that people should never, never give out any banking details or account numbers over the telephone.
"Banks, building societies and reputable businesses never ask for this information."
