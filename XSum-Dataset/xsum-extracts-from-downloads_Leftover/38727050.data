[XSUM]INTRODUCTION[XSUM]
Derby County eased past Ipswich Town to rise to sixth place in the Championship and add more pressure on Tractor Boys boss Mick McCarthy.

Craig Bryson gave the Rams an early lead when he struck from the edge of the area, before Thomas Ince curled in a stunning effort to double the lead.
Shortly after Bryson hit the crossbar, Darren Bent added a third when he headed home from close range.
Ipswich struggled for clear-cut chances, while Derby missed several.
Ince, whose earlier effort came after he drifted in from the right to score his 11th goal of the season, could only hit the post from a low cross by Bent in the second half.
Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski also made smart saves from both Bent and Jacob Butterfield.
The hosts had a late penalty appeal when Grant Ward went down in the area, shortly before Kieffer Moore's shot was deflected wide on his home debut.
The result leaves the hosts with just one win from their last seven games, a run which included being knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Lincoln City.
There was further bad news for McCarthy's men, with influential forward Tom Lawrence replaced at half-time because of injury.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "It looked like an ordinary start from both teams, but the first goal was far too easy for me, as was the second.
"We'd had a bit of a rally just before the third goal, when we should have scored from a corner kick, but then we give the ball away and it ends up in the net.
"It's quite clearly a foul in the build-up, which is not irrelevant because at 2-0 we could maybe get back in it, but 3-0 has put the game to bed."
Derby manager Steve McClaren: "We should have scored more goals, but you can't have everything. I thought we were great in the first half - we've been so disappointed with our starts over recent games.
"There were some tremendous performances and to come here and win 3-0 means the credit has to go to the players.
"The most important thing in the second half was not to be complacent, keep a clean sheet and take home the three points."
