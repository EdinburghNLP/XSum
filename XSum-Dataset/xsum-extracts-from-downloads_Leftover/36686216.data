Jung won aboard Sam, who was a late replacement when Fischertakinou contracted an infection in July.
France's Astier Nicolas took silver and American Phillip Dutton won bronze as GB's William Fox-Pitt finished 12th.
Fox-Pitt, 47, was competing just 10 months after being placed in an induced coma following a fall.
The three-time Olympic medallist, aboard Chilli Morning, produced a faultless performance in Tuesday's final show-jumping phase.
But the former world number one's medal bid had already been ruined by a disappointing performance in the cross-country phase on Monday.
He led after the dressage phase, but dropped to 21st after incurring several time penalties in the cross country.
Ireland's Jonty Evans finished ninth on Cooley Rorkes Drift.
