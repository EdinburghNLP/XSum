Durrant held several positions in the youth set-up, then stepped up to work with the first team during Walter Smith's second spell as manager in 2007.
He was first-team coach when Ally McCoist succeeded Smith in 2011, then returned to working with the youths again after McCoist resigned during season 2014-15.
