The Swift Archway Cranford 545 caravan was stolen from a site in Yaxley, Cambridgeshire, on Thursday night.
Davis tweeted "My touring caravan was stolen.. even though it was locked up with hitch & wheel lock! I want to swear... #rotters".
He added the thieves could have "headed north or south on A1, or west on A14".
Cambridgeshire Police said: "We have had a report of a caravan being stolen in the Yaxley area between 5pm on Thursday and 12.45pm on Friday. We are investigating."
Davis, who played the role of Wicket in the third of the original Star War movies, is also appearing in the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII.
Davis's credits include Professor Flitwick in the Harry Potter films and Nikabrik in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian.
Anyone with information about the caravan is asked to call Cambridgeshire Police.
