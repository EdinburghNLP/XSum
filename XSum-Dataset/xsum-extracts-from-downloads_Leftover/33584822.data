New Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron says he "absolutely supports equality" amid questions over his Christian faith and politics.

Earlier this week, he refused to answer the question of whether he believed homosexual sex was a sin.
But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he was "passionate about LGBT-plus rights" and defending equal marriage would be "at the top of my agenda".
He also said he wanted to extend the marital rights of transgender people.
Appearing on Channel 4 News on Friday, Mr Farron, who beat Norman Lamb to the leadership, was asked three times if he believed homosexual sex was a sin.
Each time, he refused to give a direct answer, instead choosing to say "my firm belief is we are all sinners".
Mr Farron was asked by Andrew Marr why he voted against the Equality Bill in 2007 - a law which would have made it harder for businesses to discriminate against gay people.
"Let me be crystal clear, I'm a liberal and I absolutely support equality," he replied.
"I'm passionate about LGBT-plus rights, for example, and as the leader of a liberal party, that is something that will be at the top of my agenda throughout the time that I am leader of our party.
"Not just defending the law on equal marriage, but also saying there are areas where it needs to be extended."
Mr Farron said transgender people currently did not have equal access to marriage due to something known as the spousal veto - which means the husband or wife of someone who has changed gender must give their consent in order for the marriage to continue.
He said the Lib Dems tabled an amendment to the Equality Bill because of concerns about "protection of individual liberties" and when that was defeated he voted against the bill.
He did not answer directly when asked what those concerns were, but said: "I am absolutely in favour of equal access under law for all people whatever their sexuality."
