McManus netted from close range on the quarter-hour mark to open the scoring and Ross Forbes' deflected strike quickly doubled Morton's lead.
A shot by Kyle McAusland pulled Alloa back into the game before half-time.
But another McManus finish and one by Denny Johnstone late on ensured a comfortable win for the hosts.
