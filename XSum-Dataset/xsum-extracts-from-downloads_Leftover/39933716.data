KLM has added a 06:00 weekday flight from the Highlands airport and an evening flight from Schiphol.
Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (Hial) said the flights would allow people to spend a full day in the Netherlands before returning home.
It is the latest addition from KLM since it started Inverness-Amsterdam flights last year.
