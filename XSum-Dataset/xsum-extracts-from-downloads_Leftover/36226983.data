Parts of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean are up to 11 kilometres deep, so we know little about what sea life there is.

The three-month expedition is looking for things like fish, mud volcanoes and deep sea coral.
So far they've spotted shrimp, jellyfish and black pillow lava from an underwater eruption.
