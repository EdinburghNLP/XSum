The body of the 36-year-old was found in a house in Glenfinnan Road around 15:05 on Wednesday.
Two officers were seen at the property on Friday afternoon. It was cordoned off by police tape and a bunch of flowers lay outside.
Earlier police said a post-mortem examination would be carried out to establish the exact cause of death.
They added: "A report will be sent to the procurator fiscal."
