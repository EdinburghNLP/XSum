Clarkson, 30, joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship against Alloa on Saturday.
He scored nine goals at Dundee last season and has featured mainly as a substitute so far this term.
"I'm ready, I've been fit all season and I'm as fit as I've ever been," Clarkson told the St Mirren website.
"I've been playing games, playing for the U20s and I like to keep my match fitness up.
"I've been training hard and making sure that when my time came, wherever it may be, that I was ready and match fit and hopefully up to speed with everyone else really. I'm looking forward to getting started."
Capped twice for Scotland in 2008 and with one international goal to his name, Clarkson has made almost 400 senior appearances at club level.
His previous teams include Bristol City, Brentford and Bristol Rovers.
St Mirren are eighth in the Championship, seven points clear of bottom side Alloa.
"Obviously the game on Saturday, every game is a big game, and the more games we can win the more confidence we can get from that we can hopefully go on a run of games and push up the table and try to get the club back to where it has been," added Clarkson.
