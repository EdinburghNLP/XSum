The males, two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London, were reported missing in March amid fears they were planning to travel to Syria.
They were stopped by Turkish officials and arrested on their return to the UK.
The teenagers, who have not been named, were bailed while police carried out further inquiries.
Scotland Yard said they were all released without charge on Monday 8 June.
It is understood they had flown to the Turkish city of Istanbul from Barcelona in Spain. The teenagers were all detained at Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen airport.
Their arrests came weeks after an international police hunt was launched to find three London schoolgirls who travelled to Istanbul on their journey to Syria.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 - all from east London - took flights to Istanbul in February, from where it is feared they travelled to join Islamic State (IS) militants in Syria.
IS has taken over large swathes of Syria and Iraq, with the aim of establishing a "caliphate", a state ruled by a single political and religious leader according to Islamic law.
