The firm filed an application with the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday in a bid to boost growth in one of the world's fastest growing movie markets.
Imax's China profits jumped nearly 30% last year, according to the filing.
It has been rapidly expanding in the Greater China region, nearly doubling the number of theatres since 2012.
March figures indicate Imax has 239 theatres in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, but the company says it is planning to build another 219 theatres in China.
News of the listing comes as box office revenue in the world's second largest economy jumped 36% last year to $4.9bn (Â£3.2bn), which is nearly three times more than it was 2010.
The parent company is already listed in New York and its shares rose as much as 9% after the announcement.
