Dan Groves said the "finer points" of a deal which could see Wright buy 20% of the club are yet to be released.
The Sun reported that the 30-year-old will become a club director.
Billericay are eighth in the Isthmian League Premier Division, three points adrift of a play-off place.
Wright, who was runner-up in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2011, played non-league football for a succession of clubs, including Lewes, Crawley Town and Rushden & Diamonds.
Billericay have recently been taken over by multi-millionaire Glenn Tamplin, who said shortly after completing a deal for the club that he was "comfortable" investing Â£10,000 a week.
The club signed former England international Paul Konchesky, 35, at the start of March.
