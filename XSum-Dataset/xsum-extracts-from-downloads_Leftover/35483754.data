[XSUM]INTRODUCTION[XSUM]
Celtic were once again the biggest movers and shakers in the Scottish Premiership during January, finishing with a flamboyant flourish by trading in a moody Turk who has been a flop in Glasgow for a moody Englishman who made his name playing for Turkey.

As Nadir Ciftci sloped off to Eskisehirspor on loan, fellow forward Colin Kazim-Richards, formerly of Fenerbahce and Galatasaray, arrived from Feyenoord just as his suspension for threatening a journalist came to an end.
Whether or not either Turk will delight enough to be hits with their new clubs, it is another loanee who has the potential to set Celtic Park alight if he lives up to his market value.
Patrick Roberts moved to Manchester City in the summer for about £12m and the 18-year-old winger has 18 months with the reigning Scottish champions in which to prove himself worthy of the fee paid to Fulham.
Kazim-Richards is perhaps even more of a gamble, not only because of his off-field antics but also for a lack of career goals, and steady Erik Sviatchenko is maybe a safer bet to prove worthy of the £1.5m Celtic paid Midtjylland for the Denmark defender.
Celtic might need to squeeze every last pound of value out of their new arrivals to thwart a sustained Aberdeen title challenge that appears to have surprised even those inside Pittodrie.
The Dandies' deadline-day signing of Simon Church on loan from MK Dons means they have a striker hungry for goals to ensure his place in Wales' Euro 2016 finals squad.
However, the Dons may live to regret their bungled attempt to sign Greg Tansey from Inverness Caledonian Thistle in events that left them minus the additional cover in central midfield manager Derek McInnes thought necessary.
While they brought in two replacements, the recall by Liverpool of promising goalkeeper Danny Ward could also prove costly in the long run.
Third-top Hearts made the biggest profit during January as they arranged a deal that should mean they pocket more than £1m for the sale of Osman Sow to Henan Jianye, who also bought Ryan McGowan from Dundee United, as the Chinese Super League begins to flex its financial muscle.
The Edinburgh club have replaced the Swede with Abiola Dauda, a Nigerian striker on loan from Vitesse who has an even more impressive scoring record.
Elsewhere, there was the usual influx and exchange of journeymen pros, with Dundee United failing to make the kind of exciting acquisitions that will transform their fans' hopes into expectation that they can bridge the gaping points gap at the bottom of the table.
