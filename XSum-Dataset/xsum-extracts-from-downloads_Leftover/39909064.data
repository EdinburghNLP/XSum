[XSUM]INTRODUCTION[XSUM]
Gorka Izagirre emerged strongest from a breakaway group to claim victory on stage eight of the Giro d'Italia as Bob Jungels retained his overall lead.

It was the 29-year-old Spaniard's first Grand Tour stage win and Movistar's first at this year's Giro - still led by Jungels, with Geraint Thomas second.
Thomas' Team Sky team-mate Mikel Landa's late attack was caught as time gaps in the top 10 stayed the same.
Thomas is six seconds behind Jungels, with fellow Briton Adam Yates third.
Orica-Scott rider Yates is 10 seconds behind Quick-Step's Jungels, on the same time as favourites Nairo Quintana and Vincenzo Nibali, who also finished safely in the main bunch on Saturday.
Landa had built up a lead of 15 seconds on Jungels - a gap that would have seen him climb into the overall lead - before being reeled back by the peloton on the up-and-down finish into Peschici.
Sunday's stage takes the riders into the high mountains for the first time since stage four, with a summit finish on the category-one Blockhaus ending a relatively flat 149km from Montenero di Bisaccia.
