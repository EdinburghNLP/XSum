Ken Dickie, 64, died in hospital on 14 May, six days after the incident at the Rockley Park site in Poole.
Jamie Mitchell, 35, of Apple Close, had admitted intervening in an argument between Mr Dickie and his mother.
He shouted "yes" and was visibly shaking after the verdict was announced by a jury at Winchester Crown Court.
The trial heard Mrs Mitchell and Mr Dickie had been in a relationship for several years and were going through a "down phase" when Mr Mitchell visited his mother at the park on 7 May.
In the evening, Mr Mitchell accompanied his mother and Mr Dickie to the holiday park bar and got "tanked up" on alcohol.
The two men had a confrontation outside and were separated by members of the public.
Mr Mitchell had pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight.
He and his mother Samantha, 57, also of Apple Close, also admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice by lying about the course of events.
The court heard the pair had initially told police that Mr Dickie had pushed Mrs Mitchell and she had pushed him back.
But Mr Mitchell later told police that he had tried to push the couple apart, causing what he described as a "tragic accident".
The pair will be sentenced on 6 February.
