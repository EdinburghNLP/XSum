Ryan Walls took pictures of 101 passengers during the Edinburgh Festival in 2015.
The 42-year-old said only two people refused out of the 103 people he asked due to being in a hurry and having a bad hair day.
Now the father-of-three's pictures will go on display at Out of the Blue Drill Hall, Dalmeny Street, in August.
Mr Walls told the BBC Scotland news website how he took photographs of a hen party, stag do, football fans, a chef, a high court judge and a TV agony aunt from Kuwait.
He said: "Everyone was so nice. One of the pictures is of a passenger who was in such a hurry that he couldn't wait for another taxi when I discovered the central locking system was broken so I had to pull him in and out of the taxi window.
"I also had an elderly former English teacher who had suddenly decided she wanted to go out to a show at the festival at the last minute and she had lots of words of encouragement for me so I really enjoyed chatting with her.
"I also got a Jambo fan and was worried I wasn't going to get a Hibs fan but luckily I did.
"I'm really interested in people and wanted to capture that moment in my cab, I only had seconds to take a few pictures and I'm really pleased with the end result."
The exhibition runs from 31 July until 5 August.
