A Porthcawl RNLI crew with a medic and the coastguard search and rescue helicopter were sent to Sker Beach, near Kenfig Nature Reserve, at 12:50 GMT on Sunday.
Crewman Chris Page said the rider had head injuries and was very cold from lying unconscious on wet sand.
She was treated before being flown to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales.
