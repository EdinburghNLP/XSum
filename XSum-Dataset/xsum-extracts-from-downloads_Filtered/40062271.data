Hull city councillor Steven Bayes also pleaded not guilty to possessing an extreme pornographic image when he appeared at the city's crown court.
The 55-year-old was suspended from the Labour Party in October after it "became aware of a police investigation into him", a party spokesman said.
He was released on unconditional bail and is due to stand trial on 5 February 2018 at the same court.
Mr Bayes was first elected as a councillor in 1985.
He was involved in Hull's bid to secure the UK City of Culture title and is a former vice chair of the Hull 2017 company, which is organising arts activities and events for the year-long celebration.
